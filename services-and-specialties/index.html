<h1>Additional Information</h1>

<h2 id="play-therapy">Play Therapy</h2>
<p>
  The language of children is Play. In a Play Therapy setting, a child is provided the opportunity, encouragement and age-appropriate means to express perceptions and emotions, increase confidence, and become aware of power to make choices. Here, the therapist's role is to establish an atmosphere of safety, understanding, and presence. The rules of the play therapy room are simple: nothing can be intentionally broken; no one can be intentionally hurt; and, with the exception of the sand tray materials, toys and art supplies are usually put away by the end of the session.
</p>
<p>
  In the Play Therapy session, communication between the child and the therapist (and sometimes, parent) can occur through a wide variety of activities, toys and materials. Such things as therapeutic games, puppets, and art materials are offered as means of engagement in this process. In addition, therapeutic stories, calming techniques, exploration of cause-and-effect in thoughts and actions, and role play are utilized to develop new skills in building positive peer relationships and expanding competencies, as well as increasing emotional awareness, appropriate expression, and management. In this environment of trust and acceptance, unconscious perceptions may be revealed and new patterns can begin to emerge.
</p>
<p>
  Consultation with the parent(s) about the Play Therapy sessions occurs at regular intervals, usually when the child is not present. Observations of themes of play, relational patterns, and the child's perceptions of the world are discussed and recommendations are made accordingly.
</p>
<p>
  Within this framework, the child, parent(s), and therapist collaborate to enhance the child's self-awareness and to increase the sense of understanding and connection within the family.<br><a href="#top">Back to top of page</a>
</p>


<h2 id="sand-tray-therapy">Sand Tray Therapy</h2>
<p>
  This therapeutic process has been described as the externalization of dream work. How figures are chosen, how they are arranged in the tray and their symbolic meanings all give cues to the inner world of children and adults. The client may choose to tell a story about the tray or a selected figure or may choose to work silently and let the tray "speak for itself." When the sand tray is a part of a child's therapy, the progression of the sand tray work is discussed with the parents in a private consultation session.
  <br><a href="#top">Back to top of page</a>
</p>

<h2 id="emdr">EMDR: Eye Movement Desensitization & Reprocessing</h2>
<p>
  EMDR is a therapeutic technique that has been shown to be particularly effective in the treatment of post-traumatic stress. It has also been reported to be a part of successful treatment of panic attacks, anxiety, and disturbing memories. Similar to REM sleep, the eye back-and-forth eye movements (or bi-lateral audio or kinesthetic stimulation) of this therapeutic technique appear to facilitate the brain's natural processing systems to integrate events and intense emotions.
</p>
<p>
  In an EMDR session, the therapist and client work together to identify the specific physical sensations, thoughts and emotions that are associated with or causing the distress, along with any negative beliefs or perceptions that have been formed due to the event. Also identified is a desired, positive belief to replace the limiting, negative perception. Then, a series of eye movements, hand taps or audio signals are facilitated by the therapist with the request that the client simply notice what sensations or thoughts come to mind. There are brief check-in's as the material and its corollaries are processed and becomes less disturbing. Gradually, there is a shift in the client's internal perception towards integration and resolution of the self and the event.
</p>
<p>
  To determine if EMDR is an appropriate technique for a specific problem, the client and therapist meet for at least one consultation session prior to any EMDR sessions. If the client and therapist agree that EMDR would be a beneficial treatment or adjunct to "talk therapy," the EMDR sessions begin. The number of sessions required for the course of treatment depends on several factors including the complexity of the problem and its impact in the client's life.
  <br><a href="#top">Back to top of page</a>
</p>

<h2 id="tft">TFT: Thought Field Therapy</h2>
<p>
  The basis of Thought Field Therapy is the theory that thoughts and emotions create a psychological field in our awareness that can be accessed and affected by tapping specific points on the energy meridians of the body. It has been shown to be effective in the treatment of post-traumatic stress, anxiety, phobias, and persistent grief or anger.
</p>
<p>
  In a TFT session, the client is directed to gently tap specific points on the face, torso, and hands where the energies of specific emotions tend to be held. The sequence of the tapping is determined by the form of the emotional distress and is repeated until the distress is significantly reduced or gone. There is no focus on the "story" or cognitive elements of the sensation; the process is geared to re-balancing natural energy flow that has been interrupted by the specific emotional perturbation. The relaxation of emotional intensity is often quite rapid and surprising to the client. Once the energetic-emotional field is calm, shifts in cognitive beliefs, as well as other perceptions and patterns, can occur more easily.

<h2 id="mindfulness-meditation">Mindfulness Meditation</h2>
<p>
  Mindfulness Meditation is a method of training the mind to relax and simply notice what is happening in the present moment. Judgment, worry, and planning are suspended; and space for sensing peacefulness and well-being is opened. In the course of practicing this kind attentiveness to one's inner experiencing, there is a natural expansion of a deep sense of connection and compassion. The kindness that is developed in relationship with oneself begins to show up in relationship with others as well.
</p>
<p>

Research has shown that a sustained practice of Mindfulness Meditation:
<ul>
   <li>Increases ability to focus and think clearly, even under stressful conditions</li>
   <li>Decreases feelings of anxiety, stress, and depression</li>
   <li>Improves physical health and performance</li>
   <li>Enhances creativity</li>
   <li>Expands compassion & feeling of connection within oneself & with others</li>
 </ul>
</p>
<p>
Mindful awareness of physical and emotional sensations can lead to insights of patterns and perceptions that directly affect the experience of whatever situations come to us. The tone and quality of attention that is given to internal and external events directly affects how those events are experienced. In addition, recent research suggests that a consistent practice of mindful awareness can influence neurological changes in the brain itself, changes that lead to greater integration of information and energy as we move through a day's, or a life's, events.
</p>
<p>
The positive effects of mindfulness meditation and mindful awareness are cumulative -- the more consistent and sustained the practice and implementation of these qualities into daily life, the greater the benefits. Establishing a practice of finding a peacefulness within, rather than basing one's sense of well-being on external circumstances, is particularly relevant in times of transition and uncertainty.

<h2 id="mindful-relating">Mindful Relating</h2>

<p>Mindful Relating describes a way of being with another person (or persons) that engages vulnerability, transparency, and awareness of oneself and others in service of deep connection. With its focus on presence, acceptance, and equanimity, it is a practice of intersubjective meditation. At times this way of being in relationship leads to healing and transformation; it nearly always leads to deeper understanding and expansion of perspective.</p>

<p class="tagline"><i>"A conscious relationship is one that calls forth who you really are."</i><br>John Welwood</p>

<p>Sourced in the teachings of Authentic World &amp; Integral Philosophy, the focus of this relational practice is to be

fully present and awake to what is happening with an attitude of openness and curiosity . The qualities of

mindfulness and compassion are consciously engaged in service of deepening awareness of the field of

connection. The invitation is to expand one&#39;s perspective to truly see the world as another person sees and

experiences it, while simultaneously being conscious of the impact this awareness has on the self. This practice

enhances awareness of the relational field as it is being co-created. In this field, there is discovery about oneself

and others in order to be more profoundly here together.</p>

<p>The modes of this way of being are developed through Mindful Relating Games and a relational practice called Integral Circling. In this field of co-creation and co-discovery, we come to recognize and experience our shared humanity on a deep, profound level.<p>

<p>Mindful Relating Games are fun and highly interactive group exercises that explore ways of seeing, connecting, and appreciating oneself and others at a deeper level. Engaging with oneself and others in this safe, spontaneous container affords the opportunity to create and foster a culture of conscious connection, positive regard, and authenticity in relationship.<p>

<p class="tagline"><i>"I think the greatest gift you can give someone is<br>an honest receiving of what that person has to offer." </i><br>Fred Rogers</p>

<p>Marianne began her training with Authentic World in 2011. Since then, she has facilitated training intensives and

weekend workshops in Boulder, CO, San Francisco and Santa Cruz, CA</p>
<p>She offers Mindful Relating courses, workshops and retreats throughout the year and facilitates Games and Team Building Practices with organizations and businesses.<br><a href="#top">Back to top of page</a> </p>
