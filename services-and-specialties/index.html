<h1>Additional Information</h1>

<h2 id="mindfulness-meditation">Mindfulness Meditation</h2>
<p>
  Mindfulness Meditation is a method of training the mind to relax and simply notice what is happening in the present moment. Judgment, worry, and planning are suspended; and space for sensing peacefulness and well-being is opened. In the course of practicing this kind attentiveness to one's inner experiencing, there is a natural expansion of a deep sense of connection and compassion. The kindness that is developed in relationship with oneself begins to show up in relationship with others as well.
</p>
<p>

Research has shown that a sustained practice of Mindfulness Meditation:
<ul>
   <li>Increases ability to focus and think clearly, even under stressful conditions</li>
   <li>Decreases feelings of anxiety, stress, and depression</li>
   <li>Improves physical health and performance</li>
   <li>Enhances creativity</li>
   <li>Expands compassion & feeling of connection within oneself & with others</li>
 </ul>
</p>
<p>
Mindful awareness of physical and emotional sensations can lead to insights of patterns and perceptions that directly affect the experience of whatever situations come to us. The tone and quality of attention that is given to internal and external events directly affects how those events are experienced. In addition, recent research suggests that a consistent practice of mindful awareness can influence neurological changes in the brain itself, changes that lead to greater integration of information and energy as we move through a day's, or a life's, events.
</p>
<p>
The positive effects of mindfulness meditation and mindful awareness are cumulative -- the more consistent and sustained the practice and implementation of these qualities into daily life, the greater the benefits. Establishing a practice of finding a peacefulness within, rather than basing one's sense of well-being on external circumstances, is particularly relevant in times of transition and uncertainty.

<h2 id="ecotherapy">Ecotherapy</h2>
<p>
  Especially in this time of environmental crisis and climate change, we sense disruption in our bodies, psyches and spirit. Ecotherapy engages direct, conscious  relationship with the healing power of Earth and all her beings as a bridge to re-integration and stabilization. As we remember and reconnect with the world outdoors, something deep-inside relaxes and a sense of belonging is revitalized. Catalyzing and cultivating awareness of our natural kinship with Earth activates compassion, healing and transformation.
</p>
<p>This shift is indicated by significant physiological, psychological and emotional changes such as decreased blood pressure, enhanced immune system, decreased stress, increased calm and feeling of well-being. Simply being outdoors -- stepping away from habits of doing, striving or accomplishing a goal -- is now being prescribed by physicians and other health-care professionals as part of treatment for heart conditions, diabetes, asthma, high blood pressure and many other ailments.
</p>

<p><i>“When stressed or overwhelmed, the immediate relief is always in the softening, and the surrendering. Your surrounding world already offers its medicine everywhere. Place your hands in the soil to feel grounded. Wade into water to feel cleansed and healed. Fill your lungs with fresh air to feel mentally clear. Raise your face to the heat of the sun to feel your own immense power. You are part of the earth, and comprised of the very same elements. And this is something you should remember.”</i> – Victoria Erickson</p>

<p>Forest Bathing, Earthing, Sensory Awareness, and Mindfulness Meditation are a few of the  evidenced-based wellness-practices of Ecotherapy.</p>

<h2 id="mindful-relating">Mindful Relating</h2>
<p>
  Mindful Relating describes a way of being with another person (or persons) that engages vulnerability, transparency, and awareness of oneself and others in service of deep connection. With its focus on presence, acceptance, and equanimity, it is a practice of intersubjective meditation. At times this way of being in relationship leads to healing and transformation; it nearly always leads to deeper understanding and expansion of perspective.
</p>
<p>
  <i>"A conscious relationship is one that calls forth who you really are."</i> -- John Welwood</p>
</p>
<p>Sourced in the teachings of Authentic World & Integral Philosophy, the focus of this relational practice is to be fully present and awake to what is happening with an attitude of openness and curiosity. The qualities of mindfulness and compassion are consciously engaged in service of deepening awareness of the field of connection. The invitation is to expand one's perspective to truly see the world as another person sees and experiences it, while simultaneously being conscious of the impact this awareness has on the self. This practice enhances awareness of the relational field as it is being co-created. In this field, there is discovery about oneself and others in order to be more profoundly here together.</p>
<p>
  <i>"I think the greatest gift you can give someone is an honest receiving of what that person has to offer.” </i> -- Fred Rogers</p>
</p>
<p>Marianne began her training with Authentic World in 2011. Since then, she has facilitated training intensives and weekend workshops in Boulder, CO, San Francisco and Santa Cruz, CA
</p>

<p>She offers Mindful Relating courses, workshops and retreats throughout the year and facilitates Games and Team Building Practices with organizations and businesses.</p>

</p>

<h2 id="thought-field-therapy">Thought Field Therapy</h2>
<p>
  The basis of Thought Field Therapy is the theory that thoughts and emotions create a psychological field in our awareness that can be accessed and affected by tapping specific points on the energy meridians of the body. It has been shown to be effective in the treatment of post-traumatic stress, anxiety, phobias, and persistent grief or anger.
</p>
<p>
  In a TFT session, the client is directed to gently tap specific points on the face, torso, and hands where the energies of specific emotions tend to be held. The sequence of the tapping is determined by the form of the emotional distress and is repeated until the distress is significantly reduced or gone. There is no focus on the "story" or cognitive elements of the sensation; the process is geared to re-balancing natural energy flow that has been interrupted by the specific emotional perturbation. The relaxation of emotional intensity is often quite rapid and surprising to the client. Once the energetic-emotional field is calm, shifts in cognitive beliefs, as well as other perceptions and patterns, can occur more easily.
